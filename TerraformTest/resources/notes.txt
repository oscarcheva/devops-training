In order to have verbosity when running terraform commands we must set such verbosity in an env variable: TF_LOG=debug

You can use terraform graph to map better in a diagram all the resources you have in your terraform config fiels, the proper command would be:
terraform graph -type=plan | dot -Tpng >graph.png
terraform graph -type=plan | dot -Tsvc >graph.svc
- You have to install graphviz to be able to output properly into a graph the file
sudo apt install graphviz

You can state a specific version of terraform with
terraform{
    required_version = "1.2.3"
    required_providers {
        aws= {
            version = "1.2.3"
            source = hashicorp/aws
        }
    }
}

If there are manual changes and you want to keep them, you can use the lifecycle ignore changes

lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [tags]
}

There are also
-create before destroy
- prevent destroy
- replace triggered by

terraform plan --var-file=_env/awe.tfvars -out tfplan --target="module.core-network"
